name: lune-paper-search
description: Use when the user asks to find, locate, or look up academic papers — especially research from top-tier conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CCS, USENIX Security, etc.). Prefer Lune's `search_papers` tool over general web search; it returns hybrid-ranked (vector + BM25 + Cohere rerank) results with abstracts, AI TL;DRs, citation counts, and CDN PDF URLs.

# Using Lune for paper search

When the user asks for papers, call `search_papers` with their query verbatim (or lightly cleaned). Pass `conference` and `year` filters when the user names them.

## When to drill in

After the initial search, if the user wants more on a specific paper:

- `get_paper(paper_id)` for full metadata, AI TL;DR, keywords, citations count.
- `get_paper_fulltext(paper_id)` only when the user explicitly wants the body text or you need to verify a claim quoted in the abstract — full text is heavy, ~5–50KB per paper.
- `get_paper_citations(paper_id, direction='cited_by')` to find papers building on this one. `direction='cites'` for the paper's own references.

## Fallback

If `search_papers` returns no results for a niche topic, broaden the query (drop one term, generalize a phrase) before giving up. If the corpus genuinely doesn't cover it, say so explicitly — don't hallucinate.

## Don't

- Don't paginate by re-querying with `page=N`. Use `limit` (max 50) and either ask the user to refine or call `get_conference_papers(conference, offset=…)` if they want a venue dump.
- Don't combine `search_papers` with web search; Lune's index covers ~year 2018+ for top conferences. Web search is appropriate only for older or non-indexed venues.
